# Feature Requirement Document: Roster Scenarios Tier-Based Optimization

## 1. Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive feature requirement specification for the enhancement of the "Roster Scenarios" functionality within the fantasy football auction draft application. The primary objective of this enhancement is to significantly improve the intelligence and strategic alignment of player selection within each defined roster scenario. Specifically, the system will be refined to prioritize the selection of "best-fit" players based on their assigned tier and corresponding cost value, with a paramount focus on acquiring higher-tier players, particularly for the "Stars and Scrubs" draft strategy. This document aims to provide Claude Code with a detailed understanding of the required logical modifications, ensuring a robust and accurate implementation that directly addresses the user's stated needs for more optimized roster suggestions.

The current iteration of the application provides users with three distinct roster scenarios: "Balanced Build," "Stars and Scrubs," and "Depth Strategy." While these scenarios offer valuable strategic frameworks, the underlying player selection mechanism does not consistently prioritize player quality (as indicated by tier) in a manner that fully leverages the available player data. This often results in sub-optimal player assignments, especially within the "Stars and Scrubs" scenario, where the intent is to secure top-tier talent. This document will meticulously detail the necessary adjustments to the player selection algorithms, ensuring that the application's recommendations are both strategically sound and reflective of real-world draft principles.

## 2. Current Implementation Analysis

### 2.1 Overview of `RosterScenarios.tsx`

The `RosterScenarios.tsx` component is central to this feature, responsible for defining, displaying, and calculating potential rosters based on various strategic approaches. As observed from the provided source code, the component encapsulates the definitions of the three primary scenarios: `Balanced Build`, `Stars & Scrubs`, and `Depth Strategy`. Each scenario is characterized by a `name`, `description`, a list of `strategy` points, and a `budgetAllocation` object. The `budgetAllocation` object, as currently implemented, provides a proportional distribution of a hypothetical budget across different player positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, K, DEF, BENCH).

### 2.2 Player Data and Sorting (`getAvailablePlayersByPosition`)

The application leverages a `Player` interface, which includes critical attributes such as `id`, `name`, `price`, `projected_points`, `tier`, and `position_rank`. Crucially, the `getAvailablePlayersByPosition` function is designed to filter and sort the `availablePlayers` array. The sorting logic within this function is a foundational element for the proposed enhancements. It correctly prioritizes players by `tier` (where a lower `tier` value indicates a better player) and then, for players within the same tier, by `cost_value` (where a higher `cost_value` is preferred). This sorting mechanism is essential for identifying the highest-quality players available for any given position.

### 2.3 Roster Building Logic (`buildScenarioRoster`)

The `buildScenarioRoster` function is the core of the scenario generation. It takes a `RosterScenario` object as input and attempts to populate the user's roster based on the scenario's strategy and the `remainingBudget`. The current implementation initializes a `builtRoster` based on the user's `roster` and tracks `budgetRemaining` and `usedPlayerIds`. A key observation is the conditional logic for the `stars-scrubs` scenario, which attempts to fill positions with the "best available players within budget, prioritizing tier 1 players." However, the subsequent loop iterates through `positionPriority` and then `emptySlots`, selecting the `bestPlayer` based on `playerCost <= budgetRemaining` and `!usedPlayerIds.has(player.id)`. While it calls `getAvailablePlayersByPosition`, the subsequent selection logic does not explicitly re-evaluate or strictly enforce tier prioritization within the budget constraints for all positions, leading to the user's observation that it's "not optimizing for tier as much as I'd like it to, especially for the 'Stars and Scrubs' scenario."

For other scenarios (e.g., `Balanced Build`, `Depth Strategy`), the current logic relies on `budgetAllocation` percentages and calculates a `budgetPerSlot`. Players are then selected if their `playerCost` is less than or equal to `budgetPerSlot` and `budgetRemaining`. This proportional allocation, while a good starting point, also needs to be coupled with a more rigorous tier-first selection process to ensure optimal player acquisition within the allocated budget.

### 2.4 Identified Gaps and Inefficiencies

The primary inefficiency lies in the disconnect between the robust sorting performed by `getAvailablePlayersByPosition` and the subsequent player selection within `buildScenarioRoster`. While players are correctly ordered by tier and cost, the `buildScenarioRoster` function, particularly for the `Stars and Scrubs` scenario, does not consistently pick the absolute highest-tier player available for a given position within the budget. Instead, it appears to prioritize filling slots based on a general budget constraint rather than a strict tier-first, then cost-value-within-tier approach. This leads to scenarios where a lower-tier player might be selected if their cost fits a general budget allocation, even if a higher-tier player is available for a similar or slightly higher, yet still affordable, price.

Furthermore, the current implementation's handling of the "fill remaining with $1-3 players" for "Stars and Scrubs" and the "no player over $35" for "Depth Strategy" could be more explicitly tied to the tier-first selection. The goal is not just to find *any* player within the price range, but the *best possible tier* player within that range.

## 3. Problem Statement

The current implementation of the "Roster Scenarios" feature, specifically the player selection mechanism within the `buildScenarioRoster` function, fails to consistently and optimally prioritize player tiers when populating fantasy football rosters. This deficiency is most pronounced in the "Stars and Scrubs" scenario, where the strategic intent is to acquire a limited number of elite, high-tier players and then fill the remaining roster spots with cost-effective, yet still tier-optimized, players. The existing logic does not sufficiently guarantee the selection of the highest-tier available players for key positions, even when budget permits, leading to a deviation from the core strategic objective.

This problem manifests in several key areas:

1.  **Sub-optimal Tier Prioritization:** Despite the `getAvailablePlayersByPosition` function correctly sorting players by tier and then cost, the `buildScenarioRoster` function does not always select the highest-tier player available for a given position within the remaining budget. This is particularly critical for scenarios like "Stars and Scrubs," where securing top-tier talent is paramount.
2.  **Inconsistent Budget-Tier Balancing:** The current budget allocation logic, while attempting to distribute funds, does not always effectively balance cost constraints with the imperative to acquire the best possible tier. This can result in situations where budget is left unspent, or lower-tier players are selected when higher-tier, budget-appropriate alternatives exist.
3.  **Incomplete Roster Filling with Tier Optimization:** The requirement to fill all roster spots, including bench positions, with at least a $1 allocation is not consistently coupled with a tier-first optimization. When filling these minimum-cost slots, the system should still endeavor to select the highest-tier player available for $1, rather than simply the cheapest.
4.  **Lack of Strict Enforcement for Scenario Constraints:** For scenarios with specific constraints, such as "no player over $35" in the "Depth Strategy," the enforcement needs to be absolute and integrated with the tier-prioritization logic. The system must ensure that the selected player not only meets the cost constraint but is also the highest-tier player available within that constraint.

In essence, the current system provides strategic frameworks but falls short in executing the player selection with the necessary precision regarding player quality (tier). The user's expectation is that these scenarios will populate "best-fit" players by prioritizing the highest tier available for each position and then intelligently managing the cost value to fit within the overall $200 budget. The proposed solution aims to rectify these issues by introducing a more sophisticated player selection algorithm that strictly adheres to tier-first prioritization while meticulously managing budget constraints across all roster spots.

## 4. Proposed Changes: Enhanced Roster Scenario Logic

To address the identified shortcomings and meet the user's requirements, significant enhancements will be made to the `buildScenarioRoster` function and its supporting logic. The core principle guiding these changes is a strict, tier-first player selection approach, coupled with intelligent budget management and adherence to scenario-specific constraints. The goal is to ensure that every roster spot is filled with the highest-tier player possible within the given budget and strategic parameters.

### 4.1 General Principles for All Scenarios

All roster scenarios, regardless of their specific strategic nuances, will operate under the following fundamental principles:

1.  **Absolute Tier Prioritization:** When evaluating available players for any given roster spot, the system MUST unequivocally prioritize players with the lowest (best) `tier` value. This means that a Tier 1 player will always be preferred over a Tier 2 player, a Tier 2 over a Tier 3, and so forth, assuming all other constraints (budget, position, availability) are met. Only when multiple players share the exact same best available tier will `cost_value` be considered as a secondary sorting criterion, with a preference for higher `cost_value` (indicating a potentially more valuable player within that tier).

2.  **Rigorous Budget Adherence:** The cumulative cost of all players assigned to the proposed roster MUST NOT, under any circumstances, exceed the `remainingBudget` provided to the `RosterScenarios` component. The system will dynamically track the `budgetRemaining` throughout the player assignment process, ensuring that no player is selected if their acquisition would lead to a budget overrun. This requires a more granular and iterative budget deduction process as players are assigned.

3.  **Guaranteed Full Roster Population:** Every single roster spot, including all starting positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, K, DEF) and all designated bench spots, MUST be filled. This is a non-negotiable requirement. If, after attempting to fill a position with tier-optimized players within the scenario's budget and constraints, no suitable player can be found, the system MUST allocate a minimum of $1 to that spot. In such cases, the cheapest available player (prioritizing by tier first, then by cost) will be assigned to ensure the roster is complete. This ensures that the user always receives a fully populated roster suggestion.

4.  **Adaptive Budget Allocation:** The allocation of the `remainingBudget` across different positions will be more adaptive. Instead of rigid percentages, the system will dynamically adjust the available budget for each position based on the number of empty slots, the overall `remainingBudget`, and the specific strategic priorities of the scenario. This allows for more flexible and intelligent spending, especially when targeting elite players or filling out the roster with minimum-cost players.

### 4.2 Enhanced Logic for Specific Scenarios

#### 4.2.1 Balanced Build

For the "Balanced Build" scenario, the existing proportional budget allocation serves as a reasonable starting point. However, the player selection within each position's allocated budget will be significantly refined to strictly adhere to the tier-first prioritization principle. The system will iterate through each position, identifying the number of empty slots. For each slot, it will attempt to find the highest-tier player available whose `cost_value` fits within the dynamically calculated budget for that position. The budget for each position will be a function of the total `remainingBudget`, the number of empty slots across all positions, and the scenario's `budgetAllocation` percentages. The $1 minimum allocation per player for any remaining empty slots will be consistently applied, ensuring that even the cheapest players are selected with tier in mind.

#### 4.2.2 Stars and Scrubs

The "Stars and Scrubs" scenario demands the most substantial logical overhaul to truly embody its strategic intent. The revised approach will involve a multi-phase player acquisition process:

1.  **Elite Player Acquisition Phase:** The system will first prioritize securing 1-2 highest-tier Running Backs (RBs) and 1 elite Wide Receiver (WR1). This phase will involve directly searching for Tier 1 RBs and WRs from the `availablePlayers` list. For each target elite player, the system will attempt to assign the highest-tier player whose `cost_value` can be accommodated by the `remainingBudget`. The actual `cost_value` of these elite players will be immediately deducted from the `budgetRemaining`. If multiple Tier 1 players are available, the one with the highest `cost_value` (implying higher projected value within that tier) will be preferred, as long as it fits the budget. This ensures that the "Stars" are truly elite and acquired first.

2.  **Dynamic Scrub Allocation Phase:** After the elite players have been secured, the system will transition to filling the remaining roster spots. The `remainingBudget` will be primarily allocated to acquire players within the $1-3 cost range. Crucially, the selection of these "scrubs" will still adhere to the tier-first prioritization. This means that if a Tier 5 player costs $2 and a Tier 6 player costs $2, the Tier 5 player will be selected. If multiple players are available at the same tier within the $1-3 range, the one with the highest `cost_value` will be preferred. This ensures that even the "scrubs" are the best possible value for their price point.

3.  **Late-Round QB and TE Strategy:** For the Quarterback (QB) and Tight End (TE) positions, the system will specifically target players with lower `cost_value` (e.g., typically in the $1-5 range, but dynamically adjusted based on remaining budget and available players). Within this lower cost constraint, the system will still prioritize acquiring the highest-tier QB and TE available. This aligns with the "late-round QB and TE" aspect of the strategy, ensuring cost-effectiveness without completely sacrificing quality.

#### 4.2.3 Depth Strategy

For the "Depth Strategy" scenario, the core constraint of "no player over $35" will be strictly enforced throughout the player selection process. Any player whose `cost_value` exceeds $35 will be immediately excluded from consideration for this scenario. The player selection will proceed with a tier-first prioritization, but always within this $35 cost ceiling. This ensures that the roster is built with a focus on value and depth rather than top-heavy spending.

1.  **Maximized Bench Depth:** The allocation for bench spots will be optimized to maximize the number of quality players within the $35 per-player limit. The system will prioritize filling bench spots with the highest-tier players available under $35, ensuring that the "strong bench depth" aspect of the strategy is fully realized.

2.  **Consistency Over Ceiling (Future Consideration):** While the current `Player` interface primarily provides `projected_points`, a future enhancement could involve incorporating a "consistency" metric. If such data becomes available, the player selection logic for the "Depth Strategy" could be further refined to favor players with higher consistency scores, even if their raw `projected_points` are slightly lower than a more volatile, higher-ceiling player. For the immediate implementation, the focus remains on tier-first within the cost constraint.

## 5. Technical Implementation Details: Refactoring `buildScenarioRoster`

The primary area of modification will be the `buildScenarioRoster` function within `RosterScenarios.tsx`. The current structure, while functional, requires a more sophisticated approach to player selection that explicitly incorporates tier prioritization and dynamic budget management. The proposed refactoring will introduce helper functions and a more structured flow to ensure that each scenario's unique requirements are met with precision.

### 5.1 Core Helper Function: `assignPlayer`

To streamline player assignment and enforce the tier-first logic, a new helper function, `assignPlayer`, will be introduced. This function will encapsulate the logic for finding the best-fit player for a given position, considering maximum price, minimum tier, and ensuring the player has not already been used. Its signature and behavior will be as follows:

```typescript
/**
 * Attempts to assign a player to an empty slot for a given position, respecting budget, tier, and price constraints.
 * @param position The position for which to find a player (e.g., 'RB', 'WR', 'QB').
 * @param maxPrice Optional: The maximum price a player can cost for this slot. If null, no max price constraint.
 * @param minTier Optional: The minimum (best) tier a player should be. If null, no tier constraint beyond sorting.
 * @returns true if a player was successfully assigned, false otherwise.
 */
const assignPlayer = (position: string, maxPrice: number | null = null, minTier: number | null = null): boolean => {
  // Find the first empty slot for the specified position
  const emptySlotIndex = builtRoster.findIndex(s => s.position === position && !s.player);
  if (emptySlotIndex === -1) return false; // No empty slot for this position

  // Get available players, already sorted by tier then cost_value (descending)
  const availablePlayersForPosition = getAvailablePlayersByPosition(position);
  
  // Find the most suitable player based on constraints
  const suitablePlayer = availablePlayersForPosition.find(player => {
    const playerCost = Number(typeof player.cost_value === 'string' ? player.cost_value.replace('$', '') : player.cost_value) || 1;
    const playerTier = player.tier || 99; // Default to a high tier if not specified

    // Apply price constraint if provided
    const priceConstraintMet = maxPrice === null || playerCost <= maxPrice;
    // Apply tier constraint if provided (lower tier is better)
    const tierConstraintMet = minTier === null || playerTier <= minTier;

    // Ensure player is within budget, not already used, and meets all constraints
    return playerCost <= budgetRemaining && 
           !usedPlayerIds.has(player.id) && 
           priceConstraintMet && 
           tierConstraintMet;
  });

  if (suitablePlayer) {
    const playerCost = Number(typeof suitablePlayer.cost_value === 'string' ? suitablePlayer.cost_value.replace('$', '') : suitablePlayer.cost_value) || 1;
    
    // Assign the player to the found empty slot
    builtRoster[emptySlotIndex] = {
      ...builtRoster[emptySlotIndex],
      player: {
        id: suitablePlayer.id,
        name: suitablePlayer.name,
        price: playerCost,
        projected_points: suitablePlayer.projected_points || 0,
        tier: suitablePlayer.tier,
        position_rank: suitablePlayer.position_rank,
        isPotential: true // Mark as potential player for scenario
      }
    };
    budgetRemaining -= playerCost; // Deduct cost from remaining budget
    usedPlayerIds.add(suitablePlayer.id); // Mark player as used
    return true; // Player successfully assigned
  }
  return false; // No suitable player found for this slot
};
```

### 5.2 Refactored `buildScenarioRoster` Logic

The `buildScenarioRoster` function will be restructured to leverage the `assignPlayer` helper and implement the scenario-specific logic in a clear, sequential manner.

```typescript
const buildScenarioRoster = (scenario: RosterScenario) => {
  const builtRoster = [...roster]; // Start with current roster state
  let budgetRemaining = remainingBudget; // Initialize with the total remaining budget
  const usedPlayerIds = new Set<string>(); // Track players already assigned in this scenario

  // Add already drafted players (from user's actual roster) to the used set
  rosterData.forEach(r => usedPlayerIds.add(r.player.id));

  // Helper function (as defined above) will be nested or accessible here
  // const assignPlayer = ...

  // Determine the total number of empty slots that need to be filled
  const totalEmptySlotsToFill = builtRoster.filter(slot => !slot.player).length;

  // --- Scenario-Specific Logic --- 

  if (scenario.id === 'stars-scrubs') {
    // Phase 1: Acquire Elite Players (Stars)
    // Attempt to get 1-2 Tier 1 RBs
    assignPlayer('RB', null, 1); // Try for a Tier 1 RB
    assignPlayer('RB', null, 1); // Try for a second Tier 1 RB

    // Attempt to get 1 Elite WR1 (Tier 1)
    assignPlayer('WR', null, 1);

    // Phase 2: Fill remaining positions with 


cost-effective players (Scrubs)
    const positionsToFillWithScrubs = [/* All positions except those already filled by stars */];
    // Prioritize positions based on remaining roster needs or general importance
    const scrubPositionOrder = ["QB", "WR", "TE", "FLEX", "K", "DEF", "BENCH"];

    for (const position of scrubPositionOrder) {
      // Determine how many slots for this position are still empty
      const emptySlotsForPosition = builtRoster.filter(slot => slot.position === position && !slot.player).length;
      for (let i = 0; i < emptySlotsForPosition; i++) {
        // For QB and TE, try to get a slightly higher max price if budget allows, but still prioritize cheap
        let currentMaxPrice = 3; // Default for scrubs
        if (position === 'QB' || position === 'TE') {
          // Allow slightly more for QB/TE if budget is ample, but still keep it low
          currentMaxPrice = Math.min(budgetRemaining / (totalEmptySlotsToFill - usedPlayerIds.size), 10); // Example: up to $10 if budget allows
          currentMaxPrice = Math.max(currentMaxPrice, 3); // Ensure at least $3
        }
        assignPlayer(position, currentMaxPrice); // Try to assign a player within the scrub price range, prioritizing tier
      }
    }

  } else if (scenario.id === 'depth-build') {
    // Logic for Depth Strategy
    const positionsToFill = ["QB", "RB", "WR", "TE", "FLEX", "K", "DEF", "BENCH"];
    for (const position of positionsToFill) {
      const emptySlotsForPosition = builtRoster.filter(slot => slot.position === position && !slot.player).length;
      for (let i = 0; i < emptySlotsForPosition; i++) {
        assignPlayer(position, 35); // Assign player with max price $35, prioritizing tier
      }
    }

  } else if (scenario.id === 'balanced') {
    // Logic for Balanced Build
    // This scenario will primarily rely on the proportional budget allocation and then tier-first filling.
    // First, calculate a dynamic budget per slot based on the scenario's budgetAllocation percentages.
    const totalAllocatedBudget = Object.values(scenario.budgetAllocation).reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);
    
    // Sort positions by their budget allocation percentage (descending) to fill higher-priority positions first
    const positionsByBudgetAllocation = Object.entries(scenario.budgetAllocation)
      .sort(([,a], [,b]) => (b as number) - (a as number))
      .map(([pos]) => pos);

    for (const position of positionsByBudgetAllocation) {
      const emptySlotsForPosition = builtRoster.filter(slot => slot.position === position && !slot.player).length;
      if (emptySlotsForPosition === 0) continue;

      // Calculate a target budget for this position based on its allocation and remaining overall budget
      const positionBudgetShare = (scenario.budgetAllocation[position as keyof typeof scenario.budgetAllocation] / totalAllocatedBudget);
      const targetBudgetForPosition = budgetRemaining * positionBudgetShare;
      
      // Distribute this target budget across the empty slots for this position
      const budgetPerSlotForPosition = Math.max(1, targetBudgetForPosition / emptySlotsForPosition); // Ensure at least $1 per slot

      for (let i = 0; i < emptySlotsForPosition; i++) {
        // Attempt to assign a player within the calculated budget for this slot, prioritizing tier
        assignPlayer(position, budgetPerSlotForPosition); 
      }
    }
  }

  // --- Final Pass: Fill any remaining empty slots with $1 players --- 
  // This ensures all roster spots are filled, even if no suitable player was found earlier.
  const stillEmptySlots = builtRoster.filter(slot => !slot.player);
  for (const slot of stillEmptySlots) {
    const availablePlayersForPosition = getAvailablePlayersByPosition(slot.position);
    // Find the cheapest available player that hasn't been used, prioritizing tier
    const cheapestPlayer = availablePlayersForPosition.find(player => 
      !usedPlayerIds.has(player.id) && 
      ((Number(typeof player.cost_value === 'string' ? player.cost_value.replace('$', '') : player.cost_value) || 1) <= budgetRemaining)
    );
    
    if (cheapestPlayer) {
      const playerCost = Math.max(1, Number(typeof cheapestPlayer.cost_value === 'string' ? cheapestPlayer.cost_value.replace('$', '') : cheapestPlayer.cost_value) || 1);
      const slotIndex = builtRoster.findIndex(s => s.position === slot.position && !s.player);
      if (slotIndex !== -1) {
        builtRoster[slotIndex] = {
          ...builtRoster[slotIndex],
          player: {
            id: cheapestPlayer.id,
            name: cheapestPlayer.name,
            price: playerCost,
            projected_points: cheapestPlayer.projected_points || 0,
            tier: cheapestPlayer.tier,
            position_rank: cheapestPlayer.position_rank,
            isPotential: true
          }
        };
        budgetRemaining -= playerCost;
        usedPlayerIds.add(cheapestPlayer.id);
      }
    } else {
      // If no player can be found even for $1, assign a placeholder to ensure the slot is filled
      const slotIndex = builtRoster.findIndex(s => s.position === slot.position && !s.player);
      if (slotIndex !== -1) {
        builtRoster[slotIndex] = {
          ...builtRoster[slotIndex],
          player: {
            id: `placeholder-${slot.position}-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)}`,
            name: `Placeholder ${slot.position}`,
            price: 1,
            projected_points: 0,
            tier: 99, // Assign a very low tier for placeholders
            position_rank: 999,
            isPotential: true
          }
        };
        budgetRemaining -= 1; // Deduct $1 for the placeholder
      }
    }
  }

  return builtRoster;
};
```

## 6. Testing Considerations

Thorough testing is paramount to ensure the correctness and robustness of the enhanced roster scenario logic. The testing strategy will encompass unit tests, integration tests, and comprehensive edge case analysis.

### 6.1 Unit Tests

Unit tests will be developed for the `buildScenarioRoster` function and its helper `assignPlayer`. These tests will focus on verifying the player selection logic in isolation, ensuring that:

*   **Tier Prioritization:** For a given set of `availablePlayers` and `budgetRemaining`, the `assignPlayer` function consistently selects the highest-tier player that meets the specified `maxPrice` and `minTier` constraints.
*   **Budget Adherence:** The `budgetRemaining` is accurately decremented after each player assignment, and no player is selected if their cost would exceed the available budget.
*   **Player Uniqueness:** The `usedPlayerIds` set correctly prevents the same player from being assigned to multiple slots within a single scenario build.
*   **Scenario-Specific Logic:** Each scenario (`balanced`, `stars-scrubs`, `depth-build`) is tested independently to confirm that its unique player selection rules (e.g., elite player acquisition for "Stars and Scrubs," $35 max for "Depth Strategy") are correctly applied.
*   **Minimum $1 Allocation:** Verify that if no suitable player can be found within budget, a $1 player (or placeholder) is assigned to ensure the slot is filled.

### 6.2 Integration Tests

Integration tests will involve testing the `RosterScenarios` component with various realistic inputs for `remainingBudget`, `emptySlots`, `roster`, and `availablePlayers`. These tests will aim to:

*   **End-to-End Scenario Generation:** Confirm that when a scenario is selected, the `buildScenarioRoster` function correctly generates a complete and strategically aligned roster suggestion.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** Verify that as players are drafted (simulating changes to `roster` and `remainingBudget`), the scenario suggestions dynamically update to reflect the new state.
*   **Applicability Logic:** Ensure that the `isStrategyApplicable` function correctly identifies when a strategy is no longer viable based on drafted players.

### 6.3 Edge Case Analysis

Specific attention will be paid to testing edge cases that could expose vulnerabilities in the logic:

*   **Very Limited Budget:** Test scenarios where the `remainingBudget` is extremely low (e.g., less than $10), ensuring that the system can still fill all slots, even if it means assigning multiple $1 players.
*   **Few Available Players:** Test with a sparse `availablePlayers` list, including cases where no high-tier players are available for certain positions, or where only players exceeding the budget are available.
*   **No High-Tier Players:** Simulate situations where the `availablePlayers` list contains no players meeting the `minTier` requirement for elite player acquisition in "Stars and Scrubs," ensuring the system gracefully handles this and moves to the next best option.
*   **Full Roster:** Test the behavior when the `roster` is already full or nearly full, ensuring the component correctly handles zero `emptySlots`.
*   **Zero Budget Remaining:** Test when `remainingBudget` is $0, ensuring all remaining slots are filled with $1 players.

## 7. Future Considerations

While the immediate focus is on implementing the tier-based optimization, several areas warrant consideration for future enhancements to the "Roster Scenarios" feature:

*   **Projected Points Integration:** Currently, `projected_points` is available in the `Player` interface but is not explicitly used in the player selection logic for scenario building, beyond its role in the initial `getAvailablePlayersByPosition` sorting (where higher `cost_value` might correlate with higher projected points). For the "Depth Strategy," where consistency is valued, integrating a more direct consideration of `projected_points` or a derived "consistency score" could further refine player selection. This would involve modifying the `assignPlayer` function to potentially factor in projected points as a tie-breaker or a secondary criterion after tier and cost.

*   **User Customization:** Allowing users to define their own custom roster scenarios, including specific budget allocations per position, tier preferences, and even custom constraints (e.g., "no player from team X"), would significantly enhance the flexibility and utility of the feature. This would likely involve a new UI for scenario creation and persistence of user-defined scenarios in the database.

*   **Performance Optimization for Large Datasets:** For very large `availablePlayers` datasets (e.g., thousands of players), the current iterative approach within `buildScenarioRoster` and `assignPlayer` could potentially impact performance. Future optimizations might include:
    *   **Indexing:** Ensuring that `availablePlayers` is efficiently indexed or pre-processed for quick lookups based on position, tier, and cost.
    *   **Batch Processing:** Exploring ways to batch player assignments rather than individual assignments, if feasible without compromising selection accuracy.
    *   **Memoization:** Caching results of `getAvailablePlayersByPosition` or `assignPlayer` for repeated calls with the same parameters.

*   **Advanced Strategic Nuances:** Incorporating more advanced strategic nuances, such as bye-week considerations, positional scarcity during a draft, or player upside vs. floor, could further enhance the intelligence of the scenario suggestions.
