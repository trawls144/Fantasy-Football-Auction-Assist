## Optimization Algorithm

### Value Calculation
Based on the uploaded draft sheet guidance:
- **COST** represents the maximum price to pay for positive value
- Calculate value as: `(Projected Points - Replacement Level) / Dollar`
- Replacement level based on worst starter at each position

### Roster Optimization Strategy
1. **Position Allocation** (typical $200 budget):
   - QB: 5-10% ($10-20)
   - RB: 35-45% ($70-90)
   - WR: 35-45% ($70-90)
   - TE: 5-15% ($10-30)
   - K: 0.5% ($1)
   - DEF: 0.5-2% ($1-4)
   - Bench: 5-10% ($10-20)

2. **Optimization Constraints**:
   - Must fill all starting positions
   - Cannot exceed budget
   - Maximize projected starter points
   - Maintain bench budget for depth

3. **Scenario Generation**:
   - **Balanced**: Even distribution across positions
   - **Stars & Scrubs**: 2-3 elite players + value picks
   - **Zero RB**: Punt RB early, load WR/TE
   - **Hero RB**: One elite RB + depth everywhere
   - **Late QB**: Minimum QB spend, max skill positions
